   # .new creates a new cli
   # CheesecakeProject is a module, cli is a class, .call is an instance method
   # CheesecakeProject::Cli is written this way so that you know which cli you are talking about.  
   # In this case the .new is a class method b/c the CLI class is the receiver of the method.
